This code is for the readers of the book. Feel free to download and play around with it. All reusable code is in .h files, and test*.cpp files allow testing various parts of it.

The code has been reasonably tested by the author, but no guarantees are made about its quality or behavior. I.e. the code is provided "as is", without any implicit warranty of merchantability.

I added a sample chapter for preview. Beware that it's in full color while the book is printed in black and white.

Github seems to have a bug in downloading the slides--the best way to get them is to download the entire repository.
